    This application is being developed to improve the quality of genealogical data
worldwide. It allows anyone to upload their GEDCOM family tree file and to check for 
irregularities in the dates, events, relationships and coding of the file.
The aim is to encourage people to correct errors in their files and bring their family tree
research up to a higher standard.

    TreeChecker is maintained by researchers at Utrecht University, who are using genealogical data 
to address historical, demographic and biological research questions. For further information please
